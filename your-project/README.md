## Project Description
This project carries out an analysis about how the situation of the rent prices and income have been in Barcelona for the past recent years.
The main goal of this project is to give an insight on how both variables, rent and income, relate to each other and what this relationship suppose for each neighbourhood.

## Questions & Hypotheses
The two hypothesis I set are: 
1. Get to know which are the neighbourhoods on where the rent has increased more in a range of time and if these neighbourhoods are in supposed gentrification status.
2. Check if people in each neighbourhood are addressing more expenses to pay the rent than what it is meant to be.

## Dataset
The main part of the datasets have been downloaded from Barcelona City Council Open Data website and from Catalan Statistical Institute.

## Workflow
First of all, came a search for the datasets to use for the project. Once have them, set a hypothesis to answer to define the aim and the structure of the work.

Afterwards came the hard coding part and the analysis followed by the results and the conclusions. Graphs and plots were used both with matplotlib/seaborn and Tableau.


## Organization
I created a data folder to save datasets to further analyse and another one to save the csv files from the results got.
In the main folder there is the code and the technical report of the project. Also a figures file was added to save all the graphs and plots used during the project.
